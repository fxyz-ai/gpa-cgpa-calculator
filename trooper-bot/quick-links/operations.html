    <h1>OPERATIONS</h1>
    <p>The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is one of the largest paramilitary forces in the world, primarily responsible
    for internal security and counter-insurgency operations in India. CRPF personnel are involved in various operations
    across the country, including but not limited to:</p>
    <h3>Counter-Insurgency Operations</h3>
    <p>CRPF plays a crucial role in countering insurgencies and dealing with left-wing extremism (Maoist/Naxalite) in affected
    regions of India. They conduct anti-insurgency operations in states like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Odisha.</p>
    <h3>Counter-Terrorism Operations</h3>
    <p>CRPF is often deployed in counter-terrorism operations in conflict-prone areas such as Jammu and Kashmir. They work in
    coordination with the local police and other security forces to combat terrorism and maintain law and order.</p>
    <h3>Riot Control and Crowd Management</h3>
    <p>CRPF is frequently called upon to control riots and manage large crowds during protests, demonstrations, and public
    gatherings to ensure peace and order is maintained.</p>
    <h3>Border Security</h3>
    <p>In addition to its internal security role, CRPF also assists the Border Security Force (BSF) in guarding India's
    international borders, particularly in areas where there is a risk of infiltration or smuggling.</p>
    <h3>Election Security</h3>
    <p>CRPF personnel are often deployed during elections to ensure a peaceful and secure voting process. They help maintain
    law and order and provide security at polling stations.</p>
    <h3>Disaster Relief</h3>
    <p>CRPF is involved in disaster relief operations during natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and cyclones. They
    provide assistance in rescue and relief efforts.</p>
    <h3>VIP Security</h3>
    <p>CRPF also provides security to high-profile individuals, including politicians and visiting dignitaries.</p>
    <h3>Specialized Units</h3>
    <p>CRPF has specialized units like the Rapid Action Force (RAF) that are trained and equipped for rapid deployment in
    critical situations such as communal riots and other emergencies.</p>
    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>The CRPF also conducts training programs for its personnel and other law enforcement agencies in areas like
    counter-terrorism, jungle warfare, and disaster response.</p>
